\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:exp}
\subsection{Experimental Setup}
Our application is running on EC2 instances. 
For all our experiments we used t1.micro instances but found out that it cannot service more than 10 requests and cannot cope with bursts of traffic\footnote{http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts\_micro\_instances.html}. 
We were using t1.micro as it is part of AWS free tier group. 
So if the company anticipates say 100 users at a time, then they need 10 t1.micro instances and scale up or down accordingly.
Hence, we use the next instance type m1.small for our application. 
The auto-scaling system implementation will only  spawn m1.small instances as new instances. 
For testing each module of the system design, we developed simple python scripts which use threads. 
We use a 105KB file that will be converted to the desired format. 
The IaaS system also runs on a python script which uses boto to interface with the AWS.
